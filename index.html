      <p class="more-content">My name is Deiosha Sparks and I am 23 years old. I live in Seattle, WA but am from St. Louis, MO. I am a Medical Assitant for UW Medicine. When I'm not working or doing school work, I enjoy hanging out with my siblings, hosting movie nights, and eating at restraunts.</p>
      
      <p class="some-more">I graduated high school in 2017, then went to Seattle Central Community College and graduated in 2019 with an associate's degree. I then transferred to the University of Washington where I am currently obtaining my bachelors in Communications.</p>
      
      <p class="little-more">My goals for this course are to challenge myself daily and shift my negative thoughts to a positive mindset. Once I complete Code Fellows this year, I aim to work at Nintendo.</p>
